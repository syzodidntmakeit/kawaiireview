Luffy ends up aboard a ship under attack by fearsome pirates. Despite being a naive-looking teenager, he is not to be underestimated. Unmatched in battle, Luffy is a pirate himself who resolutely pursues the coveted One Piece treasure and the King of the Pirates title that comes with it.

The late King of the Pirates, Gol D. Roger, stirred up the world before his death by disclosing the whereabouts of his hoard of riches and daring everyone to obtain it. Ever since then, countless powerful pirates have sailed dangerous seas for the prized One Piece only to never return. Although Luffy lacks a crew and a proper ship, he is endowed with a superhuman ability and an unbreakable spirit that make him not only a formidable adversary but also an inspiration to many.

As he faces numerous challenges with a big smile on his face, Luffy gathers one-of-a-kind companions to join him in his ambitious endeavor, together embracing perils and wonders on their once-in-a-lifetime adventure.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]</p> </div> <div class="review" data-astro-cid-x3i4d5id> <h2 data-astro-cid-x3i4d5id>Review</h2>  <p>One Piece, for all its sprawling ambition and devoted fanbase, ultimately drowns in its own excesses in ways that expose fundamental storytelling weaknesses when compared to a tightly constructed psychological masterpiece like Evangelion. The anime adaptation suffers from catastrophic pacing issues that stretch single manga chapters across multiple episodes through redundant recaps, prolonged reaction shots, and glacial scene transitions that transform potentially exciting moments into exercises in viewer endurance—while Evangelion tells a complete, devastating character study in 26 episodes, One Piece meanders across over 1000 episodes without ever achieving the same emotional or intellectual depth. The show’s tonal inconsistency veers wildly between slapstick comedy and serious drama in ways that undermine its attempts at gravitas; villains receive tragic backstories that should be poignant but feel formulaic after the fifteenth iteration, whereas Evangelion maintains its oppressive psychological tension throughout and earns every emotional beat through careful character development rather than manipulative flashbacks. Thematically, One Piece trades in surface-level platitudes about friendship, dreams, and freedom that, while emotionally accessible, never approach the philosophical complexity of Evangelion’s examination of human instrumentality, the hedgehog’s dilemma, identity, depression, and the relationship between individual suffering and collective consciousness. The art and animation quality, particularly in earlier arcs, ranges from serviceable to actively poor with off-model character designs, static fight choreography, and an over-reliance on slow pans across still frames, standing in stark contrast to Evangelion’s innovative visual storytelling, symbolic imagery, and genuinely unsettling aesthetics that revolutionized the medium. Where Evangelion respects its audience’s intelligence and demands active engagement with its layered narrative and psychological realism, One Piece spoon-feeds its themes through repetitive speeches about nakama and dreams that characters shout at each other with numbing regularity, creating an illusion of depth without the substance to support it—it’s the difference between a story that fundamentally interrogates what it means to connect with others despite our intrinsic isolation versus a story that simply asserts “friends good” across a thousand episodes of content that could have been condensed into a fraction of its runtime without losing anything essential.</p>  </div> </section> </main>   <footer> <div class="container"> <p>© 2025 kawaii-san.org.

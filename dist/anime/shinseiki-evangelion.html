Mankind is unable to defend themselves against the Angels despite utilizing their most advanced munitions and military tactics. The only hope for human salvation rests in the hands of NERV, a mysterious organization led by the cold Gendou Ikari. NERV operates giant humanoid robots dubbed &quot;Evangelions&quot; to combat the Angels with state-of-the-art advanced weaponry and protective barriers known as Absolute Terror Fields.

Years after being abandoned by his father, Shinji Ikari, Gendou&#39;s 14-year-old son, returns to Tokyo-3. Shinji undergoes a perpetual internal battle against the deeply buried trauma caused by the loss of his mother and the emotional neglect he suffered at the hands of his father. Terrified to open himself up to another, Shinji&#39;s life is forever changed upon meeting 29-year-old Misato Katsuragi, a high-ranking NERV officer who shows him a free-spirited maternal kindness he has never experienced.

A devastating Angel attack forces Shinji into action as Gendou reveals his true motive for inviting his son back to Tokyo-3: Shinji is the only child capable of efficiently piloting Evangelion Unit-01, a new robot that synchronizes with his biometrics. Despite the brutal psychological trauma brought about by piloting an Evangelion, Shinji defends Tokyo-3 against the angelic threat, oblivious to his father&#39;s dark machinations.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]</p> </div> <div class="review" data-astro-cid-x3i4d5id> <h2 data-astro-cid-x3i4d5id>Review</h2>  <p>Neon Genesis Evangelion stands as the pinnacle of anime achievement because it fundamentally transcended the medium’s limitations and redefined what animated storytelling could accomplish, functioning simultaneously as a deconstruction of the mecha genre, a brutally honest psychological character study, and a philosophical treatise on human existence that refuses to offer easy answers or comfortable resolutions. Hideaki Anno crafted a narrative that operates on multiple levels—the surface-level monster-of-the-week structure gradually reveals itself as a framework for exploring depression, anxiety, trauma, sexuality, and the fundamental human paradox of desperately craving connection while fearing the vulnerability it demands, embodied perfectly in Shinji Ikari, perhaps anime’s most realistically flawed and psychologically complex protagonist who subverts every hero archetype by being paralyzed by self-loathing and the weight of others’ expectations. The show’s visual language is revolutionary, employing experimental techniques like extended silent sequences, unconventional camera angles, dense symbolic imagery drawing from Kabbalah, Christianity, and psychoanalysis, and the infamous budget-constrained finale that turns limitation into artistic triumph by literally peeling back the anime itself to expose the raw psychological condition of its characters in a way that’s more affecting than any action sequence could be. Every character serves as a fully realized exploration of different trauma responses and defense mechanisms—Asuka’s aggressive competence masking abandonment issues, Rei’s dissociation and lack of self-preservation, Misato’s forced cheerfulness hiding her own damage, Gendo’s emotional calcification—creating a tapestry of broken people whose interactions feel devastatingly real despite the fantastic setting. The series refuses to coddle its audience or provide neat resolution, instead demanding active engagement with its themes of hedgehog’s dilemma, the terror of individuality versus the annihilation of instrumentality, the Freudian psychosexual undertones, and the meta-commentary on otaku culture and anime itself, all building toward a conclusion (and subsequent film) that remains divisive precisely because it’s genuinely challenging art rather than comfortable entertainment. Where other anime might settle for spectacle or melodrama, Evangelion achieves something rarer: it captures the actual texture of mental illness, the suffocating weight of depression, the way trauma reshapes identity, and the agonizing difficulty of choosing to live and connect with others despite knowing you’ll be hurt—all wrapped in a package whose influence echoes through decades of subsequent media, making it not just the best anime, but one of the most important artistic works in any medium.</p>  </div> </section> </main>   <footer> <div class="container"> <p>© 2025 kawaii-san.org.
